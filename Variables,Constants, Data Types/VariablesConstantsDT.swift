//MARK: VARIABLES
//Definition: Places where you can store program data - they can vary meaning you can change their values freely.
//Examples:
var str = "Hello, Playground"
        str = "Goodbye"
var highscore = 0
highscore = 77
//Because
// We dont need "var" a second time because the variable has already been created - we're just changing it.
 
//MARK: CONSTANTS
//Definition: Values that are set once and can not be changed. Uses the keyword "let" instead of "var".
//Examples:
let DomainExpansion = "Infinte Void"
let myName = "Fredo-kun"

//MARK: DATA TYPES
//Definition: Swift assigns variables and constants a "type" based on what value is inputted when created. An examples of types are {String, Int, Double, Bool}
//Examples:

let album: String = "Reputation"
let year: Int = 1996
let height: Double = 8.88
let FredoRocks: Bool = true
